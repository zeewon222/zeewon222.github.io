## How to use it

**Protip:** You may find ready-to-use Lottie files at the aptly named website [lottiefiles.com](https://www.lottiefiles.com/).

### **What if my URL doesn't work?** 
Some URLs on LottieFiles (or other websites) may not work with this package, so don't be alarmed if you paste something in and receive an error. Here's an easy way to host your own JSON files...

1. Download the JSON file you want and need
2. Go to [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) to create a new Gist  (Gist is cool, so it's totally worth making an account if you haven't already)
3. Set the description to something that feels right to you â€” really make it your own
4. Set the filename to something that seems cool, don't forget the .json extension
5. Paste your beloved, properly formatted Lottie JSON into the Gist file textarea 
6. Click "create public gist"
7. Find your file in the Gist you just created and click "Raw" for this file   
8. You've arrived and are ready to copy pasta the URL of this page into the JSON URL property field
